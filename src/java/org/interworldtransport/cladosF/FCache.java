/**
 * Any classes within CladosF which would benefit from a supporting cache make
 * use of this singleton enumeration as a 'builder'. Nothing fancy here
 * otherwise. Just simple create, append, find, and remove capabilities backed
 * by ArrayLists of cached objects.
 * <p>
 * At present, the only thing in CladosF being cached is Cardinals. cladosG.Algebra
 * has its protonumber which is little more than a Cardinal. cladosG.Foot has its
 * list of cardinals too. So there are a number of places where cardinals get attached.
 * The point of this cache, therefore, is to provide a global list to the modeler
 * who wants to ensure object references match perfectly when they should. That is
 * accomplished by setting the protonumber's Cardinal to one in this list BY REFERENCE
 * instead of by string.
 * <p>
 * Be aware that the list of cached objects is inheriently mutable. Alteration of an
 * object here alters it everywhere it is referenced. ALSO... because of this cache, 
 * it is unlikely that removal of object references elsewhere (set to null) will 
 * cause the allocated memory to be garbage collected. Any linked here in the cache
 * will persist while the cache does or the reference to it in the cache does.
 * <p>
