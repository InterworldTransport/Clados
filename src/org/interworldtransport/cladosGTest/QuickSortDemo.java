/**
 * There is a speed improvement for sorting keys in an canonical basis if we use
 * a 3-way median quicksort algorithm instead of the heapsort algorithm. This
 * improvement comes at the cost of memory used, so there might be a penalty in
 * memory allocation overhead. Heapsort is stingy with extra memory being used,
 * so careful implementation of the algorithm should avoid the overhead.
 * 
 * The penalty for heap sort for 4 generator algebras in establishing a basis is
 * about 2x the number of swaps, but the total swaps amount to about 60. On even
 * an old machine, this will be lightning fast. That means it isn't worth
 * worrying about which sort is faster in filling a basis. It might make more
 * sense to focus on sorts for the geometric product instead.
