/**
 * This class is designed to be the handler of generator range exceptions. Basis
 * can be built using just an integer, but that integer must not be so large as
 * to overwhelm the machine running the code.
 * <p>
 * At present, clados uses short integers (16 bits) to track many internal
 * details. That limits the number of blades in a basis to 2^15-1 which means we
 * can support a maximum of 14 generators. Using full integers (32 bits) was
 * supported for a time, but hardware limitations make this unlikely to be used
 * in the next couple decades.
 * <p>
 * In a practical sense, a Basis making use of 14 generators is very large with
 * 2^14 (16,384) blades. Considerable time is required to generate it. The
 * related GProduct has 2^28 (268,435,456) entries in the product table.
 * Considerably more time is required to generate that. Work HAS been put into
 * making the sort algorithm for Basis and GProduct reasonably efficient, but
 * asset horsepower will matter a great deal more at this end of the range.
