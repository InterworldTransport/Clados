/**
 * A Blade is essentially an outer product space built from 0 to many vectors.
 * If the vectors aren't parallel, the blade is of higher rank than a vector. At
 * this low level, though, there is no concept of an inner product, thus no
 * sense of 'parallel'. That leaves a blade as a 'list' of distinct directions
 * and a few supporting elements including an long integer key useful for
 * comparisons and short integer necessary for knowing how many possible
 * directions might be added to this blade.
 * 
 * The directions are simply boxed short integers. They are boxed instead of
 * unboxed in order to make use of ArrayList objects which can't 'list' java
 * primitives. At present, the supported number of 'directions' is 0 to 14, so
 * the performance penalty between boxed and unboxed short integers is minor.
 * 
 * The ArrayList keeps the Shorts in natural order associated with short
 * integers. If a new direction is added, the Blade will sort the Shorts from
 * lowest to highest immediately. This ensures later retrieval will always
 * deliver directions in the same order.
 * 
 * For example, if a problem states there are six possible directions, a Blade
 * will contain zero to six of them represented as boxed Shorts 1 through 6. If
 * only 3 are in the Blade (making it a 3-blade) then only 3 will be in the
 * ArrayList. If the ArrayList is empty, zero directions are contained and the
 * blade represents a scalar.
