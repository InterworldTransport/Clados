/**
 * A Blade is essentially an outer product space built from 0 to many vectors.
 * If the vectors aren't parallel, the blade is of higher rank than a vector. At
 * this low level, though, there is no concept of an inner product, thus no
 * sense of 'parallel'. That leaves a blade as an ordered 'set' of distinct
 * directions and a few supporting elements including a long integer key useful
 * for comparisons and byte integer necessary for knowing how many possible
 * directions might ever be added to this blade.
 * 
 * The directions are simply Generators from an enumeration class. They are kept
 * in an EnumSet which uses as its sense of order the same order generators are
 * enumerated in their class. At present, the supported number of 'directions'
 * is 0 to 14, so the enumeration class lists 14 possible generators.
 * 
 * The EnumSet keeps Generators in their natural order. If a new direction is
 * added, the EnumSet will handle it 'late' in the computational sense. In other
 * words, it doesn't matter where the new generator gets added. It matters ONLY
 * when generators are iterated later when establishing a product table or
 * generating a blade key. Iterators will always deliver directions in the same
 * order.
 * 
 * For example, if a sub-manifold has six possible directions, a Blade will
 * contain zero to six of them represented as generators E1 through E6. If only
 * 3 are in the Blade (making it a 3-blade) then only E1, E2, and E3 will be in
 * the EnumSet. If the EnumSet is empty, zero directions are contained and the
 * blade represents a scalar.
