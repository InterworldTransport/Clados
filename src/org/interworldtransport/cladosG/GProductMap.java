/**
 * This class defines a geometric product for an associated basis.
 * <p>
 * GProduct encapsulates Clifford algebra geometric multiplication. GProduct
 * objects are stored as a separate class to support flat space multivectors
 * that can afford to share their product definition objects.
 * <p>
 * Operations in the GProduct should return logicals for tests the objects can
 * answer. They should alter inbound objects for complex requests. At no point
 * should a GProduct object have to make a copy of itself or inbound objects
 * except for private, temporary use.
 * <p>
 * A GProduct object will actually assume it is OK to perform the requested
 * operations and throw an exception if it discovers later that it isn't. Error
 * discovery isn't likely to be complete, so it should not be expected to work
 * well. Only checks against primitive elements can be done. Physical sense
 * checks need to be performed at the level of the object referencing the
 * GProduct or higher.
