 * information and ranges as detected by the number of generators found in a
 * blade. Finally there are also a few methods for dealing with keys, basis size
 * validation, and XML output.

 * The farther one gets from basic methods dealing with blades and span, the
 * more one is wandering off into conveniences. The various keys matter, but as

	 * This method detects whether or not the number of generators being used is

	 * in other classes.
	 * <p>
	 * For example, someone attempting to create a basis with a negative number of
	 * generators should be stopped up front without having to check for that
	 * situation themselves.
	 * <p>
	 * The trickier one, though, involves a number of generators that will blow up
	 * an internal representation in a basis or CliffordProduct class. For example,
	 * trying to build a basis with 64 generators will create a list of 2E64
	 * blades... or at least the library will try if the size isn't validated first.
	 * Perhaps the list representation of a Basis can hold that many Blades, but the
	 * keys identifying them might not if they rely on java primitives. Also, the
	 * related CliffordProduct holds a product table of all blades. Its internal
	 * representation might break too.
	 * <p>
	 * This method provides a single place to validate the intended size of a basis
	 * WITHOUT placing magic numbers in this interface. The actual limits are in the
	 * CladosConstant class as static elements.
