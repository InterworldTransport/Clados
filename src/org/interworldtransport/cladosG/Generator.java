/**
 * Generators are just place holders representing 'directions' on a manifold. It
 * is best to think of them as labels for basis directions. No assumptions are
 * encoded here about magnitudes, directions, and metrics. A Generator instance
 * merely represents the existence of a direction distinct from some other
 * direction.
 * 
 * This enumerator works a bit as a builder too. Each of its instances rely on
 * the shared static methods and potential instance methods that 'switch' on
 * their identity to determine what gets built and returned.
 * 
 * This enumeration has non-static parts for each instance, but they don't cause
 * a state change. Generator keeps a constant single byte integer in the
 * INTERNAL STATE of each instance acting like an ordinal to support finding the
 * instance from a numeric identity AND for providing numeric bounds on
 * supported sizes of related blades. Most uses of an instance will NOT make use
 * of the internal state, though, and cannot change it either way.
 *
