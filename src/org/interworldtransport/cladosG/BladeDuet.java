	 * destination in a Blade anyway. What we don't know immeidately is how many
	 * transpositions are necessary to reach that sort order. That's what this

	 * 
	 * The offered numeric signature is used for the reduction to handle sign flips.
	 * Generators with a positive square appear as a one (1) while those with
	 * negative squares appear as negative one (-1).
	 * 
	 * NOTE that the numeric signature representation is a departure with prior use
	 * in Clados where zero(0) implied no sign flip and one(1) implied sign flip for
	 * negative squared generator. Prior practice used to add up the sign flips and
	 * then look at what was left modulo 2. Ideally, what we want is a 'signed bit'
	 * sized data element to track signs.
