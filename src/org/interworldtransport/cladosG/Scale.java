/**
 * This class contains cladosF numbers that act together as the coefficients of
 * a monad. They are all children of DivField and implement Divisible, so they
 * have both a sense of 'units' and support basic arithmetic operations. Which
 * numbers are contained internally, therefore, is tracked by two private
 * elements. One contains a reference to a Cardinal that all the numbers should
 * share. The other is a reference two one of the CladosField elements so we
 * know whether this Scale is expected to contain real or complex numbers and at
 * what level of floating point precision. Access to the two private elements is
 * managed by their 'get' methods. getCardinal() and getMode(). There are set
 * methods for them too, but they are package protected methods that should not
 * be handled much by developers of physical models.
 * 
 * The data structure used to represent 'coefficients' used to be a fixed array
 * that had the same length as the number of blades in a monad's basis. That has
 * been modernized to an IdentityHashMap contained within this class. The basis
 * against which the map is applicable can be referenced by another private
 * element, but shouldn't be manipulated once set. The private element is
 * finalized.
 * 
 * An IdentityHashMap was used instead of a simpler HashMap in order to get
 * reference equality between map keys instead of object equality. Map Keys are
 * Blades from the basis, so reference equality is the correct expectation when
 * comparing keys. Typical use of keys from the map occurs with streams that
 * effectively iterate through the blades for access to coefficients in the
 * encompassing vector space. The information within a blade is far less
 * important than which blade it is, thus reference equality is what is needed.
 * 
 * Map Values are CladosF numbers like RealF or ComplexD. Because they are
 * objects instead of primitives, they behave much like Java's boxed primitives.
 * In fact, they would BE those boxed primitives if not for the need to track
 * units in physical models. For example, one meter is not one second. No
 * equality test should pass.
 * 
 * Because values are objects, care must be taken once one has a reference to
 * them. Any reference to one enables a developer to change it without the Scale
 * or Monad knowing. This is the hydra monster named Mutability. It IS a danger
 * here. Many of Scale's methods copy inbound numbers to avoid altering them,
 * but some do not INTENTIONALLY.
 * 
 * 1. Coefficient settors that accept arrays do NOT copy values before placing
 * them in the internal map. BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE
 * 
 * 2. Put() does not copy the incoming value before placing it in the internal
 * map. Again... BEWARE.
 * 
 * 3. Coefficient settors that accept maps DO COPY values before placing them in
 * the internal map. Any object from which values are taken to be used here are
 * safe from the hydra.
 * 
 * 4. All gettors for coefficients provide direct references to values in the
 * map. There most common use is INTENTIONAL MUTABILITY, so... BEWARE THE HYDRA.
 * The safest way to use them is within streams / lambdas.
 * 
 * GENERAL NOTE | Many of the methods for Scale will look a lot like Monad, so
 * one can reasonably wonder why all the extra stuff in Monad when Scale looks
 * enough like a tuple to represent things. The primary difference is that Scale
 * contains only the coefficients and references a basis like what we got used
 * to as students. That's not enough because a basis is only enough to represent
 * linear combinations for a vector space. Other geometric meanings aren't
 * in the basis. They are in the product table. Combining product table and
 * basis into an 'algebra' gives a MUCH better description of a 'tuple'
 * reference frame than a vector space.
