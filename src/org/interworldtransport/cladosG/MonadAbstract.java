	/**
	 * This method is called every time the gradeKey is set to determine whether

	 * The technique involves taking the log10 of the gradeKey and truncating it. 
	 * The first time through, one can get any integer between 1 and gradeCount inclusive. 
	 * Before the loop iterates, that integer is used to subtract 10^logKey 
	 * from gradeKey. That ensures the next pass through the loop will produce an 
	 * integer between 1 and the next lower grade unless the one just found was the 
	 * scalar grade. 
	 * Once the scalar grade is found, logKey=0, tempGradeKey=0, and the loop breaks out.
	 * 
	 * If the number of found grades is less than or equal to half the grades
	 * the sparse flag is set to true. Otherwise it is set to false.
	 * 
	 * This method isn't actually used by child classes because the method for 
	 * setting the gradeKey does the same detection one coefficient at a time
	 * breaking out when a non-zero coeff is found. Incrementing foundGrades in that
	 * loop suffices. Still... there might be a need for this method elsewhere later.
	 * 
	 * @param pGrades short
	 * The parameter is the gradeCount for the monad. It is passed into this method rather
	 * than looked up in order to allow this method to reside in the MonadAbstract class.
	 * If it were in one of the child monad classes, it would work just as well, but it
	 * would have to know the child algebra class too in order to avoid DivField confusion.
	 * Since a monad can be sparse or not independent of the DivField used, the method is
	 * placed here in the abstract parent.
