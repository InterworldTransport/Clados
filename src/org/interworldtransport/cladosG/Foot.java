/**
 * Objects within the cladosG package have a number of attributes in common that
 * relate to a point that describes where the geometry of the algebra is tangent
 * to the manifold underneath it. In a flat space it is not really necessary to
 * use a foot point, but a simple one is still used in the cladosG package to
 * help avoid the trap of assuming transport of objects along the manifold
 * doesn't cause them to re-orient and change into other objects.
 * <p>
 * At a minimum, a footPoint is the name of an event or a point and the type of
 * numbers used for scale along the coordinate paths. At this location it is
 * assumed the geometry of the algebra is aligned with the local geometry one
 * would assign to the coordinate space that is the manifold at that point. This
 * makes a footPoint the root reference frame.
