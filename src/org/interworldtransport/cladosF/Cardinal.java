/**
 * This class is a simple string holder that names a division field in a manner
 * similar to the concept of 'units' in a physical model. Examples... "metres",
 * "litres", "amperes". There is no requirement one use a particular standard
 * for unit systems, though. They are free strings.
 * <p>
 * Cardinals are meant to provide all DivFields instances with a single object
 * they may share that names them in order to speed field comparisons in
 * TypeMatch methods. A class using fields for calculations would declare only
 * one of these and then share the reference among all the objects that may be
 * operated upon by the two primary opertaions of the field. ( +, * )
 * <p>
 * This may seem like a waste of time, but it is useful when a class must be
 * prepared to use different kinds of fields without knowing in advance which
 * one will be created. It is most important when an object exists that uses
 * DivFields with unknown pedigrees. The Cardinal can be checked to discover
 * intended uses and avoid mixing apples and oranges.
 * <p>
 * One consequence of this approach is that two division fields might use
 * different Cardinal objects of the same name. The TypeMatch method in a
 * DivField will state that they are different because object equality is tested
 * instead of string content equality. This allows an application writer to keep
 * two distinct systems of numbers apart in their application even though the
 * fields are internally identical. This is useful when objects in one algebra
 * might be scaled different than objects in another. If one never intends to
 * use this feature, though, it is easy to avoid. Simply re-use a Cardinal.
 * <p>
 * Yes. This is soft typing to an OOP developer. The point is that it allows for
 * differences between objects that can't assume 'scale' means the same thing to
 * both of them. Since 'scale' and 'multiply' are NOT the same concepts, this
 * distinction is needed in some scenarios.
 * <p>
