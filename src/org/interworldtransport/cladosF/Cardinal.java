/**
 * This class is a simple string holder that names a division field.
 * Examples include Real, Complex, and Quaternion.
 * <p>
 * Cardinals are conveniences only. They are meant to provide all DivFields with 
 * a single object that names them in order to speed up field comparisons in 
 * TypeMatch methods. A class using fields for calculations would declare only 
 * one of these and then share the reference among all the objects.
 * <p>
 * This may seem like a waste of time, but it is useful when a class must be
 * prepared to use different kinds of fields without knowing in advance which
 * one will be created. It is most important when an object exists that uses
 * DivFields with unknown pedigrees.
 * <p>
 * One consequence of this approach is that two division fields might use
 * different objects to type them. The TypeMismatch method will state that they
 * are different, so this allows an application writer to keep two distinct
 * number system apart in their application even though the fields are internally
 * identical. This is useful when objects in one algebra might be scaled
 * different than objects in another.
 * <p>
 * Yes. This soft typing to an OOP developer. The point is that it allows for
 * differences between objects that can't assume 'scale' means the same thing
 * to both of them.
