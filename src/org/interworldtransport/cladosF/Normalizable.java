/**
 * This interface implements the part of the concept of a Division Field from
 * mathematics. Specifically, if is the portion that says the field supports the
 * notion of 'length' or 'magnitude' when several of them are used as scaling
 * factors in vector spaces.
 * 
 * For real numbers this is just the idea of distance from a number line origin.
 * In a vector space where several are involved, one uses a root-mean-square
 * method to combine them. Think Pythagorus.
 * 
 * For complex numbers, it is the radius in a polar representation. When several
 * are involved, it is Pythagorus again, but the squares are formed with numbers
 * and their conjugates, but computation is made easier by ignoring the
 * imaginary and just squaring the components.
