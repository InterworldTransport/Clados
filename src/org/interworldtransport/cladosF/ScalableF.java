 * This interface implements the part of the concept of a Division Field from

 * the notion of'scaling the magnitude'. 
 * <p>
 * For real numbers this is scaling the distance from a number line origin. 
 * For complex numbers, one scales the radius in a typical polar representation.
 * <p>
 * This particular interface also requires that input be delivered as a float.
