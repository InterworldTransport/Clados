	 * For real numbers this is scaling the distance from a number line origin. For
	 * complex numbers, one scales the modulus of the number which is radius in a
	 * polar representation.
	 * 
	 * This method will appear peculiar to the uninitiated. Why not just use the
	 * multiply operation they might ask. One certainly could, but in doing so one
	 * risks tripping an exception for Cardinal matching. It will often be the case
	 * that the exception makes no sense, but because it can be thrown in some cases
	 * it has to be checked in all cases. For example, scaling by "-1" and
	 * multiplying by "-1" are not the same if one is tracking the units of "-1".
	 * That's what a Cardinal is FOR in DivField subclasses which implement this
	 * interface, thus we should make the distinction between scaling by "-1" and
	 * multiplying by "-1 with a cardinal". We do so by establishing "scale" in the
	 * contract implied by this method. A "scalable" object is one that can be
	 * altered using a Number of some kind WITHOUT a cardinal check. Why not just
	 * ditch the Cardinal instead? Check the documentation for Cardinal to see why.
	 * 
	 * One very important distinction is that cladosF DivField children are scaled
	 * by Numbers from java.lang. Essentially the boxed promitives that look like
	 * numbers will do. Byte, Short, Integer, and Long along with Float & Double.
	 * Geometry in cladosG is scaled by CladosF DivField children and NOT Numbers.
	 * Why? In order to bring Cardinal into a physical model containing geometry.
