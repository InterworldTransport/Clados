/**
 * DivFields currently come in four varieties. RealF, RealD, ComplexF, ComplexD
 * To facilitate a Builder class we would give basic information and construct
 * any of them. This would be supported by an enumeration type that can't be
 * UnitAbstract itself because UnitAbstract is subclassed to make the four field
 * classes.
 * <br>
 * This enum doubles up a bit as a builder. Each of its instances rely on the
 * shared static methods and have a few instance methods of their own that
 * 'switch' on their identity to determine what gets built and returned.
 * <br>
 * This enumeration has non-static methods for each instance, but they don't
 * cause a state change. CladosField HAS NO INTERNAL STATE to change unlike the
 * Builder in the same package.
 * <br>
 * NOTE that the methods capable of creating Cardinals in this enumeration do
 * NOT cache them. Similar methods in CladosFBuilder DO cache them.
