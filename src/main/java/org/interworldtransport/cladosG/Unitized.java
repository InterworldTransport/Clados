/**
 * Anything implementing this interface has "units" in the physical sense.

 * Nothing about Clifford Algebras requires they represent quanities with
 * 'units', so this contract makes a statement that a particular class adds this
 * sense of meaning on top of any others.
 * <br>
 * This gets used with the scaling factors in Monads for now because that is the
 * part where 'weight' is applied to geometry. What units do is allow for
 * different kinds of weights.
 * <br>
 * In a nutshell, Unitized says a Scale represents units while a Cardinal
 * associated with the UnitAbstract children names the units.
