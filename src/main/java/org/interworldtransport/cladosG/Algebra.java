/**
 * The algebra object holds all geometric details that support the definition of
 * a multivector over a division field {Cl(p,q) x UnitAbstract} except for the
 * actual field. That makes this a partial abstraction of an algebra. Once an
 * actual division field is in the mix we are there, but that structure is
 * reserved for the Monad class.
 * <p>
 * The primary data structures in a Algebra are a CanonicalBasis and a GProduct.
 * Between them they define the structure of operations an Algebra can support.
 * The basis provides for most behaviors people know from vector spaces. The
 * product provides the other behaviors people know from differential forms.
 * Together, though, they enable linear combinations of multi-ranked sums, thus
 * they step beyond familiar ground from forms and outer products AND the
 * familiar ground of scalar-only multiplication in vector spaces. All elements
 * of an algebra an participate in addition and multiplication and
 * multiplicative commutativity is NOT expected.
 * <p>
 * This isn't the place to explain what Clifford Algebras are and what they do.
 * This IS the place to point that that Clados extends the idea slightly in
 * order to support future uses.
 * <p>
 * 1. An Algebra references a 'Foot' object to imitate a location where the
 * algebra's geometry is expected to be a tangent space to some underlying
 * curved sub-manifold. No attempt at curvature is made here, but the Foot
 * object IS used in reference match tests. This is intentionally done to
 * prevent different tangent spaces being compared. In a model that assumes
 * curvature on the manifold, one must first transport their frame before making
 * comparisons. No 'transport' capability is written for Clados, but it might be
 * some day.
 * <p>
 * Anyone wanting to get around this feature need only declare one 'Foot' and
 * then re-use it everywhere. The computational penalty is miniscule.
 * <p>
 * 2. An Algebra has a CladosField mode. Whether the field is real or complex
 * matters. For computational reasons, the floating point precision technique in
 * use also matters. For those reasons, an Algebra maintains an internal mode
 * reference.
 * <p>
 * 3. An Algebra has a UnitAbstract element too in order to contain the Cardinal
 * within it and to use it combined with Mode to generate field numbers. This
 * might change in the future as the builder classes mature. It used to be used
 * as an operand in a copy function frequently in Monad in Clados V1.0, but is
 * largely bypassed in V2.0. If a complete bypass happens, the UnitAbstract element
 * may be reduced to it's contained Cardinal.
 * <p>
 * 4. There is a residual reference to a list of frame names with related
 * settors and gettors. This is changing in V2.0 as frames are better described
 * by linear combinations of basis elements, which makes them sets of Scale's.
 * Algebra's WILL track them, but by reference in a more complicated manner
 * since they will be used to 'cut out' the meanings of multiplication and
 * addition.
 * <p>
 * 5. There is a UUID string kept internally for use an XML variant of
 * serialization. It has no geometric meaning. Think of it as a digital name.
 * <p>
 * 6. There is also a 'name' string for the human readable name of an algebra.
 * It has no geometric meaning and is not used for anything important.
