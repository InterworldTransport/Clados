/**
 * DivFields currently come in four varieties. {RealF, RealD, ComplexF, ComplexD}
 * To facilitate a Builder class we would give basic information and construct any 
 * of them. This would be supported by an enumeration type that can't be DivField 
 * itself because DivField is subclassed to make the four field classes.
 * 
 * The DivField builder would be a singleton that keeps track of Cardinals and builds
 * them as needed.
 * Not sure there has to be an instance tracking Cardinals, though. 
 * Could all be static methods.
 * Maybe the enum could double up as the builder, though it wouldn't be a singleton
 * except in the sense of a singleton per DivField subclass.
