/**
 * This class supports the concept of a Division Field from mathematics. Field
 * objects within the clados packages are used as 'numbers' in the definition of
 * an algebra. All Clados objects use DivField descendants as a result.
 * <p>
 * DivField's capture only a reference frame type, so they appear to be named.
 * However, they are named with Cardinal objects so their names can be shared
 * as references, thus survive reference frame match tests.
 * <p>
 * The number to be plugged in, though, doesn't appear until later in a child
 * of this class. This matters because the number of reals involved in the field
 * varies. Complex numbers require two. Quaternions would require four.
 * <p>
 * The only reason this class isn't an interface is the presence of the 
 * Cardinal data member.
