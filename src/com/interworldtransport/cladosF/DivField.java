 * This class implements the concept of a Division Field from mathematics. Field
 * objects within the clados packages are used as 'numbers' in the definition of
 * an algebra. All CladosObjects use DivFields as a result.
 * <p>
 * FivFields are not named. They do not have any geometric properties. Treat
 * them like you would any other number you could plug into a simple calculator.
 * <p>
 * The number to be plugged in, though, doesn't appear until later in a child
 * of this class. This matters because the number of reals involved varies.
 * Besides... this class is abstract.
