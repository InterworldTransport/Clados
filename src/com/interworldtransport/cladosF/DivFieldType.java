/**
 * This class is a simple string holder that names a division field type.
 * Examples include Real, Complex, and Quaternion.
 * <p>
 * Field types are conveniences only. They are meant to provide all
 * DivFieldElements with a single object that names the field type in order to
 * speed up field type comparisons in TypeMatch methods. A class using fields
 * for calculations would declare only one of these and then share the reference
 * among all the objects.
 * <p>
 * This may seem like a waste of time, but it is useful when a class must be
 * prepared to use different kinds of fields without knowing in advance which
 * one will be created. It is most important when an object exists that uses
 * field elements with an unknown pedigree.
 * <p>
 * One consequence of this approach is that two division fields might use
 * different objects to type them. The TypeMismatch method will state that they
 * are different, so this allows an application writer to keep two distinct
 * number system apart in their application even those the fields are internally
 * identical. This is useful when objects in one algebra might be scaled
 * different than objects in another.
