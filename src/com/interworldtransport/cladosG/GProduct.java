/**
 * This class defines a geometric product for an associated basis.
 * <p>
 * GProduct encapsulates Clifford algebra geometric multiplication. GProduct
 * objects are stored as a separate class to support flat space multivectors
 * that can afford to share their product definition objects.
 * <p>
 * Operations in the GProduct should return logicals for tests the objects can
 * answer. They should alter inbound objects for complex requests. At no point
 * should a GProduct object have to make a copy of itself or inbound objects
 * except for private, temporary use.
 * <p>
 * A GProduct object will actually assume it is OK to perform the requested
 * operations and throw an exception if it discovers later that it isn't. Error
 * discovery isn't likely to be complete, so it should not be expected to work
 * well. Only checks against primitive elements can be done. Physical sense
 * checks need to be performed at the level of the object referencing the
 * GProduct or higher.

	/**
	 * Set the array used for establishing the geometric multiplication results

	 * 
	 * product results are constructed by juxtaposing the generators of each
	 * blade (all of j on the left and all of k on the right) into a single
	 * array and then sorting them into ascending order from left to right and
	 * removing generator pairs from the array. Each pairwise swap made in the
	 * combined set of generators increments a counter that keeps track of the
	 * anti-commuting multiplier. Generator pairs are removed using the
	 * signature array to increment the anti-commuting counter if needed. After
	 * a final sort to move all 0 (null) generators to the left the result is
	 * keyed much like blades are in the Basis when it is constructed. Keys are
	 * finally compared to determine the identity of the resulting blade.
	 * 
	 * This method should only be called once the GProduct is initialized.
	 * Construction of the full product result array scales as
	 * blades^2=2^(2*generators), so it could take a long time and a lot of
	 * memory for a large basis. Efforts to streamline code and memory footprint
	 * in this method could have a large impact.
