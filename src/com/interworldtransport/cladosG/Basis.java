/**
 * All geometry objects within the cladosG package have elements that form a
 * basis to span the vector space related to the algebra. This basis is
 * represented in the algebra as various products of the generators. This class
 * holds a representation of all those products of generators and a few methods
 * that help to manipulate the list of indexes.
 * <p>
 * The data in this class is stored in shorts instead of ints. This is meant to
 * save some memory in applications where a number of geometric objects must be
 * active at the same time. In this case, memory footprint will influence method
 * speeds due to the amount of information stored in each geometric object like
 * a monad. In algebras with a moderate number of generators this will matter a
 * great deal.
 * <p>
 * The choice of shorts limits this class to algebras with between 0 and 14
 * generators inclusive (with 16284 blades) because 2^15-1 is the max for signed
 * shorts and 15 generators produce 2^15 blades. Switching to int's enables up
 * to 30 generators and 1,073,741,824 blades. Switching to long's enables up to
 * 62 generators and 4,611,686,018,427,387,904 blades. Perhaps when that kind of
 * hardware is available, this class should be updated. 8)
 * <p>
 * There is a speed improvement for sorting keys in an Eddington basis if we use
 * a 3-way median quicksort algorithm instead of the heapsort algorithm. This
 * improvement comes at the cost of memory used, so there might be a penalty in
 * memory allocation overhead. Heapsort is stingy with extra memory being used,
 * so careful implementation of the algorithm should avoid the overhead.
 * Heapsort has been chosen here to leave room for the physical model being
 * implemented.
 * <p>
 * The penalty for heap sort for 4 generator algebras in establishing a basis is
 * about 2x the number of swaps, but the total swaps amount to about 60. On even
 * an old machine, this will be lightning fast. That means it isn't worth
 * worrying about which sort is faster in filling a basis.
 * <p>
 * The proper way to use this class is almost as an enumeration. Once a basis
 * has been generated for a particular number of generators, one should not have
 * to do it again. If not for the high overhead associated with a basis
 * involving many generators, this would be baked into this class already. 
 * <p>
 * Instead, it is baked into the CladosGBuilder. Instantiate that object, use it 
 * to create a new Basis, and the Basis will be tracked. If one already exists
 * with the proposed number of generators, the existing one from the list will 
 * be returned instead of a new one being created.
