/**
 * All geometry objects within the cladosG package have elements that form a
 * basis to span the vector space related to the algebra. This basis is
 * represented in the algebra as various products of the generators. This class
 * holds a representation of all those products of generators and a few methods
 * that help to manipulate the list of indexes.
 * <p>
 * The data in this class is stored in shorts instead of ints. This is meant to
 * save some memory in applications where a number of geometric objects must be
 * active at the same time. In this case, memory footprint will influence method
 * speeds due to the amount of information stored in each geometric object like
 * a monad. In algebras with a moderate number of generators this will matter a
 * great deal.
 * <p>
 * The choice of shorts limits this class to supporting products with between 1
 * and 14 generators inclusive.
