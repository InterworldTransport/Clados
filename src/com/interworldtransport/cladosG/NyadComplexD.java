/**
 * Multivector Lists over a shared division field and shared algebraic foot.
 * {Cl(p1,q1)x...xCl(pn,qn) over R, C or Q and @Foot}.
 * <p>
 * Nyads encapsulate related multivectors from Clifford Algebras and the rules
 * relating them. This class keeps a list of Monads and definitions for legal
 * mathematical operations upon them.
 * <p>
 * Proper use of this class is accomplished when one views a physical property
 * as a self-contained entity and a list of properties as a description of a
 * real physical object. An electron's motion demonstrates a need for a
 * multivector list because the properties of the electron can be listed
 * independent of its motion. Enclosing related properties in a list enables a
 * complete instance representing an observable and prevents one from making
 * programmatic errors allowed by the programming language but disallowed by the
 * physics.
 * <p>
 * NyadComplexD objects must be declared with at least one Monad that has at least
 * two generators of geometry. Each Monad on the list must have the same
 * footPoint. At present, the NyadComplexD permits the encapsulated Monads to be
 * members of geometric algebras of different metric and dimensionality.
