Clados package(s): 
<ol>
<li>cladosF
<li>cladosFExceptions
<li>cladosG
<li>cladosGExceptions
</ol>
<p>
The clados packages form a working library for applications that would use geometric 
or clifford algebras to replace vector and matrix libraries. The classes are designed
to enable the software developer to work at the geometric level with their designs 
and let the library handle the underlying algebra and arithmetic.  Some rigor is 
required to use the library effectively, but examples of its use are developed elsewhere.
