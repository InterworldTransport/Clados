Clados package(s): 
<ol>
<li>cladosF
<li>cladosFExceptions
<li>cladosFTests
<li>cladosG
<li>cladosGExceptions
<li>cladosGTests
</ol>

<p>
The clados packages form a working Java library for applications that would use 
geometric or clifford algebras to replace vector and matrix libraries. The 
classes are designed to enable an engineer to work at the geometric level with 
their designs and let the library handle all underlying algebra and arithmetic.
Some extra rigor is required to use clados effectively compared to other 
geometry libraries, but examples have been written in project documentation.
