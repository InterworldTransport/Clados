Welcome to Clados …so what is it? 

It is a set of java packages that implement multi-vectors in Clifford Algebras.
	cladosG				- The geometry package
	cladosF				- The number package
	cladosGExceptions	- The geometry exception package
	cladosFExceptions	- The number exception package

If you don't know what a Clifford Algebra is, consider yourself encouraged to 
read about them elsewhere.  Geometric Algebras are a variation on a theme, so 
don't bypass content describing them. In a nutshell, they offer a mathematical
formalism combining many of the disparate tools of geometry enabling one to 
wield them in the ways we've become accustomed to from algebra. There is a 
project related book that might help, but it doesn't have introductory material. 
They book focuses upon package contents, what they do and why, and finishes
with usage examples largely associated with physics simulations.

If you have problems or think you have found an issue in Clados, please report
it at the Clados project site at GitHub. If you can take the time to look and 
see if it is already reported, it would be appreciated. Tell us you found it 
either way, though, because it helps to know the number of impacted people.

If you want to check up on what is going on, feel free to drop by the Face Book
page for Interworld Transport. That is where status updates are posted.


Thanks for your support!
