Welcome to Clados …so what is it? 

It is a set of java packages that implement multi-vectors in Clifford Algebras.
	cladosG				- The geometry package
	cladosF				- The number package
	cladosGExceptions	- The geometry exception package
	cladosFExceptions	- The number exception package
	cladosGTest			- The JUnit tests that support cladosG
	cladosFTest			- The JUnit tests that support cladosF

If you don't know what a Clifford Algebra is, consider yourself encouraged to 
read about them.  Geometric Algebras are a modeling choice variations, so don't 
bypass content describing them either. They all offer a single mathematical 
formalism combining many disparate tools of geometry enabling one to wield 
them in the algebraic ways. 

The tools contained in this library evolved from work done at UC Davis 
between the late 1970's and early 1990's. It is intended to support physical
models that rely upon geometry in the style taught by Prof. Ken Greider.

There is a project related book that might help, but it is admittedly stale 
AND doesn't have introductory material. The book focuses upon package contents, 
what they do and why, and finishes with usage examples largely associated with 
physics simulations. Two significant parts are very stale: the API and
the Mechanics model. The physics models in the book will not survive unchanged
when this library reaches version 2.0, so treat the library and book as an 
exploration/research project regarding polycovariance and the broader meaning 
of 'meaning' in physical models. Maintain a healthy sense of skepticism... 
and try things for yourself.

If you have problems or think you have found an issue in Clados, please report
it at the Clados project site at GitHub. If you can take the time to look and 
see if it is already reported, it would be appreciated. Tell us you found it 
either way, though, because it helps to know the number of impacted people.

If you want to check up on what is going on, feel free to drop by the Twitter
account for Interworld Transport. That is where status updates are posted lately.

I also hang out on the Discord server operated by the folks behind bivector.net.

Thanks for your support!

Installation:

Clados is a collection of packages meant to be used as a math library in other 
applications. Place clados.jar where you normally place 3rd party libraries.

Don't have the jar file? Build it. Or ask me to build one.

Having said all that, if you want support, bug fixes, or a different license
arrangement, let me know. I understand that some cannot stick their heads out
regarding usage of code written by others. I AM interested in how people use 
this library, so small requests are likely to be supported free of charge.
Larger ones can be negotiated.
