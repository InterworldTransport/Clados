Welcome to Clados!

…so what is it?

Clados is a set of java packages that implement multi-vectors in Clifford Algebras.  
	cladosG - The geometry package
	cladosF - The number package

If you don't know what a clifford algebra is it is best to read about them elsewhere,
but we do have a project related book that might help a little. It doesn't have much
introductory material, but it does go into each package, what they do and why.


If you have problems or think you have found an issue in Clados, please report
it at the Clados project site at GitHub. If you can take the time to look and see
if it is already reported, we would appreciate it. Tell us you found it either way,
though. It helps to know the number of impacted people.


Thanks for your support!
